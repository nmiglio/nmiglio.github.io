<p>Is there really something to say about this? </p>

<p>This is just a collection of notes I needed during my work. Some might be useful but most of them are here just because I was 
tired to search the information over and over again.  </p>

<p>A bit about the technical side. The pages are hosted for free on GitHub. The site is built using Jekyll (no databases, static 
pages, a lot of blog friendly tools) and what you see is based on the template Skinny Bones. Just a bit of work to setup all this 
stuff and then it is pretty easy to mantain.</p>
