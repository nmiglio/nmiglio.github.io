Is there really something to say about this?

This is a collection of notes I needed during my work, recipes I tried or just thoughts passed through my head. Some might be useful but most of them are here just because I was tired to search the information over and over again.

A bit about the technical side. The pages are hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (no databases, static pages, a lot of blog friendly tools) and what you see is based on the template [Skinny Bones](https://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/). 

Just a bit of work to setup all this stuff and then it is pretty easy to mantain.
